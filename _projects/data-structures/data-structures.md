# Data Structures Overview

When writing a program, there is a wide variety of commonly used data structures and algorithms available. Having taken an introductory course to the subject, me and a friend decided to write a summary of it.

The document is **only available in Swedish** and serves as a brief introduction to data structures. More specifically, it tries to concisely summarize the important points of the Chalmer's course *DAT037 Datastrukturer* as presented in 2016 and 2017. In 2018, it was [recommended as complimentary literature](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2018/course/DAT037_Datastrukturer/resources.html) for the course.

The document is available [with hyperlinks](/assets/docs/datastrukturer_sammanfattning.pdf) or [for printing](/assets/docs/datastrukturer-printing-version.pdf).
