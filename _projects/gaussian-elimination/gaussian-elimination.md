# Gaussian Elimination

As part of the Chalmer's course *EDA332 Datorsystemteknik* we were tasked with writing MIPS assembly for performing matrix triangulation. Our solution managed a second place in the course competition for the most efficient solution with an efficiency score of 554 ÂµsC$.

Checkout the [~~repository~~](https://github.com/ecen/eda332-computer-system-engineering)(currently made private on request from course supervisor) or read the [report](/assets/docs/Optimizing_Hardware_and_Software_for_Gaussian_Elimination.pdf).
