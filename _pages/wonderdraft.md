[Wonderdraft](https://www.wonderdraft.net) is a tool developed by Megasploot  for easily creating stylized fantasy maps. I've had some fun with this tool and I have put my work and some custom assets I've created.

## Wonderdraft Asset Pack

Here you can download my [Wonderdraft Asset Pack](/assets/docs/ecen_wonderdraft_assets.zip). It currently contains very little but you can use it for any personal and commercial purposes in accordance with the included (CC-BY) license.

## Atlantean Empire, ca 11 000 BCE, alternate history

### Story
(A friend of mine recommended listening to [Light of the Seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS-gbqbVd8c&list=LLfGQJjrmuK5X2l4CUlVdB3A&index=24){:target="\_blank"} while reading this.)

*Before the Younger Dryas climate catastrophe, the Atlantean empire ruled what is today North Africa and the Sahara Desert from their great city atop the Richat Structure. At this point, much of the African area lay roughly 300 meters lower than today's level, effectively making sea levels that much higher.*

*Whether by accident of Atlantean technology or natural catastrophe, most of the Atlantean Empire was destroyed around 10 000 BCE. Water levels spiked, swallowing Atlantis in the sea for a century, after which the entire continent rose to today's level over the next millennia.*

*Few Atlanteans survived, protected for generations in the remnants of Ptah workshops or hidden away in the Simerian mountains. Eventually they emerged, but with most of their old knowledge forgotten, these people could never hope to rebuild Atlantis. Even so, what little knowledge remained was more than enough to spawn new sparkling empires, even if but shadows of Atlantis.*

### Inspiration and Resources
This map is based on the notion that Atlantis might have been a city built on the [Richat structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richat_Structure) in a time where sea levels were somehow 300-400 meters higher than today. I've traced African coastlines based on [floodmap.net](http://www.floodmap.net/) when water levels are raised by 340 meters and placed mountains with based on the [Maps-for-free Relief Map](https://maps-for-free.com/). I've also had much inspiration from u/grammatiker's great map [The Atlantean Empire - A Wet Sahara](https://www.reddit.com/r/wonderdraft/comments/9q4vkz/the_atlantean_empire_a_wet_sahara_c_4500_bce/).

Locations on the map are placed near known locations of ancient civilizations or completely made up. Similarly, names (which all use the [Becker font](https://www.1001fonts.com/becker-font.html)) are based on ancient history mixed with greek words for what that city did in my version of Atlantis. (For example, consider if [Ptah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptah) was actually an Atlantean inventor.)

This was my first map with Wonderdraft and it was really fun, even though it doesn't handle this many symbols very well. I'm hoping for some performance optimizations or ability to "flatten" many symbols into one in the future. **As a developer I would definitely like to give a go at helping implement that**.

I made my own Dot-and-Ring location marker that can have different colors for the dot, ring and background glow respectively, since the stock one changes all colors together. It is available in my [Wonderdraft Asset Pack](/assets/docs/ecen_wonderdraft_assets.zip).

### Disclaimer
I was recently introduced to the Richat Structure Atlantis theory via some conspiracy theory (-isch) videos on YouTube. Thus I want to emphasize that all evidence for Atlantis being an advanced ancient civilization that we have somehow missed, is very weak. Very few arguments hold up beyond seeming plausible at first glance. It does make for some fun fantasy/alternate history settings though :)
