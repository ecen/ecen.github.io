# Greetings!

My name is __Eric Guldbrand__. I started studying **Computer Science and Engineering** at Chalmer's University of Technology in 2016 and I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in **Data Science and AI**. I love designing and developing cool or useful things, which I've been doing in my spare time for almost a decade. On top of that I am an avid gamer and sci-fi/fantasy enthusiast.

I am usually working on some project or another and this site serves as a hub for many those. Under [projects](/projects/) you can browse much of what I've done, both quite serious work, as well as more personal projects. Feel free to look around and you will find everything from my Bachelor's Thesis on machine learning in StarCraft II, to a java library for dimensional analysis, to fantasy maps!

Some of my projects are educational in nature, owing in part to my work as a teaching assistant in a few Chalmer's programming courses. In particular, me and a friend wrote [a compendium](/portfolio/data-structures/) for one of our favourite courses. We were thus very happy to see it [recommended as complimentary literature](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2018/course/DAT037_Datastrukturer/resources.html) for the course in question.

If you wish to contact me, write me an [e-mail](mailto:{{site.author.email}})!
