## Youtube
I don't really make YouTube videos. Occasionally while playing games however, I record something that I want to show a friend, or just save for myself. Because YouTube is by far the easiest way to share videos, I tend to upload those videos to my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQEFyGppq7vKkvl27dZy-bg). Feel free to browse, but don't expect much!

## [Wonderdraft Projects](/wonderdraft/)
[Wonderdraft](https://www.wonderdraft.net) is a tool developed by Megasploot  for easily creating stylized fantasy maps. I've had some fun with this tool and I have put my work and some custom assets I've created [here](/wonderdraft/).

## Minecraft Resource Pack: Lunaris
[Lunaris](/assets/projects/lunaris/Lunaris.zip) is a small resource pack I made for Minecraft. It makes the moon square (why would the Minecraft moon be round??) and changes the look of armour to something more interesting.

<div class="slider">

  <img class='photo'  src="/assets/projects/lunaris/gold-compare.png" alt="" />
  <img class='photo'  src="/assets/projects/lunaris/diamond-compare.png" alt="" />
  <img class='photo'  src="/assets/projects/lunaris/moon-compare.png" alt="" />
</div>

The armours are designed to go particularly well with this [blue knight skin](/assets/projects/lunaris/2018_12_06_blue-knight.png). I have not created that skin, and unfortunately I do not remember who the author is or were the original upload can be found. Reverse image search yields nothing, so I host it here for future reference.

### Use Lunaris on your Minecraft server
If you want to you can set this resource pack to be the default on your server! In your `server.proprties` file, just set the following:
```
resource-pack=https://eric.guldbrand.io/assets/projects/lunaris/Lunaris.zip
resource-pack-sha1=71C1A9AD830D36E93D5DE7B08CC9238866200DC4
```
The first is just a link to this resource pack. The second is the resource pack SHA1. It will be updated on this page when the resource pack is updated. You don't need to add it to your properties file, but doing so allows clients to detect if the pack has been updated and download the new version.
