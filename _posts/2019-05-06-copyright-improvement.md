title: Copyright Improvement

It seems to me that current copyright law makes very little sense. Big companies and copyright trolls use it to bully small creators and small creators don't have the resources to enforce their own claims. In addition, alot of "copyright law" is not law, but enforced through other licenses, like Creative Commons.

To fix this I've come up with what I think would be a good basis for copyright law. I don't see myself single-handedly changing international law, and I'm no lawyer, so it may be difficult for me to foresee all consequences, but atleast it makes alot of sense to me.

I suggest a law in two parts.

## ยง1 Creator Protection
Part one protects the creator, similarly to current copyright law. It is further subdivided into two parts of its own.

### Idea Protection
A creator is allowed sole use of their concept for a short time (10-20 years). For instance, if someone writes a story about an original character no one else may sell their own stories about this character while idea protection applies.

This is intended to be similar to how copyright protection works today. People do write Harry Potter fanfiction, but it isn't something they can really publish without permission.

Idea protection running out does not mean you may pose as the original author. As an example, idea protection running out for Harry potter means you may publish and sell Harry Potter books, as long as you make sure it is clear that you are not affiliated with Rowling.

### Work Protection
A creator is allowed sole use of their work and very close variations of it for a long time (50 years).

To use the previous example, when idea protection for Harry Potter runs out, fanfiction may be sold, but the original books are still protected. You may not sell digitalized versions or reprints as long as a majority of the work is still the original.

## ยง2 Consumer Protection
Part two protects the consumer, an important aspect of copyright when most consumers are also creators in some capacity.

### Fair Use
Fair use is allowed similarly to current copyright law.

Insistently, consistently or carelessly preventing fair use is punishable. This is to prevent large companies and copyright trolls from bullying small creators.

### No Unpublishing
Creators do not have the right to unpublish their work. This means that if a published work is made unavailable for some time (1 year), it enters public domain from that point onwards.

The idea is that no one is allowed to hold rights to something to prevent others from having it. It is also intended to prevent anti-consumer business practices like the Disney Vault.

This protection also applies to price. A work has to be available to consumers at a max price dependent on what similar works cost. (No more than 1.5x the average price of works with similar production value.)

### Platform Independence
A work that is made available on one platform must be freely available on all other platforms as well. The creator is not required to make it available everywhere, but creators are not allowed to stop consumers from making the work available on more platforms. This includes printing a digital book, digitizing a printed book or porting a game to a different platform. Creators may only charge once for access to all platforms.

Consumers that make work available on platforms it was not created for must hand maintenance over such repositories to the creator if requested.

Unpublishing on any platform means that the work may be freely accessed by anyone on that platform. The creator may not assert any more influence on that platform.
