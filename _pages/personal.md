## Youtube
I don't really make YouTube videos. Occasionally while playing games however, I record something that I want to show a friend, or just save for myself. Because YouTube is by far the easiest way to share videos, I tend to upload those videos to my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQEFyGppq7vKkvl27dZy-bg). Feel free to browse, but don't expect much!

## [Wonderdraft Projects](/wonderdraft/)
[Wonderdraft](https://www.wonderdraft.net) is a tool developed by Megasploot  for easily creating stylized fantasy maps. I've had some fun with this tool and I have put my work and some custom assets I've created [here](/wonderdraft/).
