# Welcome

## Greetings!

My name is __Eric Guldbrand__ but I often go by __Ecen__ online. I study computer science at Chalmer's University of Technology in Gothenburg but I am also an avid gamer and sci-fi/fantasy enthusiast.

This site hosts my [résumé](/resume/) and [portfolio](/portfolio/) but serves likewise as a repository for more personal projects. My intention is to some extent make clear who I am, and to provide a bunch of hopefully useful code snippets and programs for the interested.

If you wish to contact me there are several links for that on this page, but e-mail might be your best bet.
