## About me

My name is **Eric Guldbrand**. I started studying Engineering Physics at Chalmer's University of Technology in 2014. While fun, there was for me a desperate lack of computer science courses. As such I changed my major to **Computer Science and Engineering** in 2016, to which I am still attending.

Since then I have worked as an instructor for [Programmeringsveckan Göteborg](http://programmeringsveckan.se), as well as a teaching assistant for a couple of Chalmer's courses, namely *Introduktion till Programmering* and *Programmeringsteknik*.

I spend alot of my free time working on interesting side projects, many of which I try to account for in my [portfolio](/portfolio/). Whereas I identify much with gaming culture and creating games, so far my side projects have mostly been on other subjects, and to a large extent, education.
