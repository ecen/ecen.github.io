## [Dimensional Analysis Library: Unit](unit/)
A small **Java library** that makes it easier to work with variables modeling physical quantities. It makes sure you only perform valid operations and it also allows you to define entirely custom units. Here is a small example:

```java
U myUnit = new U(U.M, 3, "my", "my unit"); // 1 my = 3 meters
UV x = new U(5, myUnit); // x = 5 my
System.out.println(x.convert(U.YARD)); // Prints "16.40 yard"
```

## [An Overview of Introductory Data Structures](/portfolio/data-structures/)
A document summarizing the important points of *DAT037 Datastrukturer*, a Chalmer's introductory course to data structures. **Only available in swedish.**

[Read more](/portfolio/data-structures/) about it or [download the pdf](/assets/docs/datastrukturer_sammanfattning.pdf).

## A Concise Introduction to Concurrent Programming
Concurrent programming can be an important skill for any programmer. Much literature unfortunately delves too deeply into theory to effectively convey the quite intuitive basic concepts to the beginner. In this document, I try to do just that.

The document will be available on this site in the near future.

## Hardware and Software Optimization for Gaussian Elimination
As part of the Chalmer's course *EDA332 Datorsystemteknik* me and a friend where tasked with writing and optimizing MIPS assembly code for performing matrix triangulation, the first part of Gaussian elimination. Our solution managed a second place in the course competition for creating the most efficient solution with an efficiency score of 554 ÂµsC$.
