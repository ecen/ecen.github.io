[Wonderdraft](https://www.wonderdraft.net) is a tool developed by Megasploot  for easily creating stylized fantasy maps. I've had some fun with this tool and I have put my work and some custom assets I've created.

### Background and process
March Across the Belts, a map depicting the [Cimbrian Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jutland), southern Scandinavian Peninsula and the borders of Denmark and Sweden in 1658, just before the [Treaty of Roskilde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Roskilde), was my submission to the first official Wonderdraft map competition with the theme _The End of an Ice Age_. My intention was to share a slice of Scandinavian history and of what I think is a fascinating story.

I am no historian, but during the making of this map I made cursory historical research on all cities and towns marked on the map. This allowed me to, for instance, give the size and buildings shown as town markers some relation to what their corresponding town might have been like in 1658.

The map was made to be quite accurate to real life, but I've taken some creative liberties. For instance, names of towns are a mixture of Danish, Swedish and English names of those places, from then and now. Also, how the ice would have been arranged in 1658 is complete speculation, and so is the route of the Swedish army, except the key points where I know they crossed: Fredricia, Nyborg and the general route from there to Kopenhagen.

### History
In 1658 during the [Second Northern War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Northern_War), king Charles X Gustav of Sweden led his troops from Poland, through the relative safety of [Swedish Pomerania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Pomerania) and into Danish territory. This winter was the coldest in living memory, part of what later came to be called the [Little Ice Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age), and the sea over the _Little Belt_ and _Great Belt_ had frozen solid. Making a gamble based on investigations by royal engineer Erik Dahlberg, it was decided to cross the ice. The ice sheet creaked and sagged enough that soldiers had to walk up to their ankles in water, but it did not crack. Eventually, the entire Swedish army, including cavalry and artillery, made it to Zealand and Kopenhagen. There, the Danish army who had expected a Swedish assault in spring at the earliest, panicked and surrendered.

During the ensuing Treaty of Roskilde, Denmark had to give up all their land on the southern part of the [Scandinavian Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Peninsula), including Scania, Blekinge and Halland, all of which remain Swedish to this day.

### The Little Ice Age
A period of cooling said to have started in 1250 and quickly receded after 1850, the 1650's marked a turning point of the Little Ice Age with the coldest Scandinavian winters known either before or after. Year 1658 was perhaps more the beginning of the end of an ice age than a true end, but the once-a-millennia opportunity of a winter assault by marching over the frozen sea makes for a fascinating story nonetheless. Even more so by how much it changed the Scandinavian geopolitical landscape, even until today.


## Atlantean Empire, ca 11 000 BCE, alternate history

### Story
(A friend of mine recommended listening to [Light of the Seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS-gbqbVd8c&list=LLfGQJjrmuK5X2l4CUlVdB3A&index=24){:target="\_blank"} while reading this.)

*Before the Younger Dryas climate catastrophe, the Atlantean empire ruled what is today North Africa and the Sahara Desert from their great city atop the Richat Structure. At this point, much of the African area lay roughly 300 meters lower than today's level, effectively making sea levels that much higher.*

*Whether by accident of Atlantean technology or natural catastrophe, most of the Atlantean Empire was destroyed around 10 000 BCE. Water levels spiked, swallowing Atlantis in the sea for a century, after which the entire continent rose to today's level over the next millennia.*

*Few Atlanteans survived, protected for generations in the remnants of Ptah workshops or hidden away in the Simerian mountains. Eventually they emerged, but with most of their old knowledge forgotten, these people could never hope to rebuild Atlantis. Even so, what little knowledge remained was more than enough to spawn new sparkling empires, even if but shadows of Atlantis.*

### Inspiration and Resources
This map is based on the notion that Atlantis might have been a city built on the [Richat structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richat_Structure) in a time where sea levels were somehow 300-400 meters higher than today. I've traced African coastlines based on [floodmap.net](http://www.floodmap.net/) when water levels are raised by 340 meters and placed mountains with based on the [Maps-for-free Relief Map](https://maps-for-free.com/). I've also had much inspiration from u/grammatiker's great map [The Atlantean Empire - A Wet Sahara](https://www.reddit.com/r/wonderdraft/comments/9q4vkz/the_atlantean_empire_a_wet_sahara_c_4500_bce/).

Locations on the map are placed near known locations of ancient civilizations or completely made up. Similarly, names (which all use the [Becker font](https://www.1001fonts.com/becker-font.html)) are based on ancient history mixed with greek words for what that city did in my version of Atlantis. (For example, consider if [Ptah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptah) was actually an Atlantean inventor.)

This was my first map with Wonderdraft and it was really fun, even though it doesn't handle this many symbols very well. I'm hoping for some performance optimizations or ability to "flatten" many symbols into one in the future. **As a developer I would definitely like to give a go at helping implement that**.

I made my own Dot-and-Ring location marker that can have different colors for the dot, ring and background glow respectively, since the stock one changes all colors together. It is available in my [Wonderdraft Assets Pack](/assets/docs/ecen_wonderdraft_assets.zip).

### Disclaimer
I was recently introduced to the Richat Structure Atlantis theory via some conspiracy theory (-isch) videos on YouTube. Thus I want to emphasize that all evidence for Atlantis being an advanced ancient civilization that we have somehow missed, is very weak. Very few arguments hold up beyond seeming plausible at first glance. It does make for some fun fantasy/alternate history settings though :)
