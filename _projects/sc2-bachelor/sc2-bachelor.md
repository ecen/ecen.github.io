Artificial intelligence research is a field of high interest for many industries, and games such as StarCraft II provide a good testing ground. In this bachelor's thesis, me and my co-authors develop tools and a simple API on top of PySC2 to make it even easier for beginners to experiment with machine learning in StarCraft II. We also test the performance of some neural network architectures for performing tasks within the game.

This project was the conclusion of our bachelor studies, but was for most of us our first venture into the specifics of machine learning using artificial neural networks.
