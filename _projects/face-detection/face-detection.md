# Face Detection using Viola-Jones Object Detection Framework

As part of the Chalmer's course *TIN175 Introduction to Artificial intelligence* we were tasked with implementing [Viola-Jones Object Detection Framework](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/viola-cvpr-01.pdf) based on one of their papers. The implementation and accompanying [short report](/projects/face-detection/face-detection-report.pdf) was written in collaboration between myself, Algot Johansson, Daniel Felczak, Oskar Gr√∂nqvist and Rikard Helgegren.
