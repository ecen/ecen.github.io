## Introduction
When writing a program, there is a wide variety of commonly used data structures and algorithms available. Having taken an introductory course to the subject, me and a friend decided to write a summary of it. 

The document is **only available in Swedish** and serves as a brief introduction to data structures. More specifically, it tries to concisely summarize the important points of the Chalmer's course *DAT037 Datastrukturer* as presented in 2017 and 2018.

The document is [available here](/assets/docs/datastrukturer_sammanfattning.pdf).
