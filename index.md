# Greetings!

My name is __Eric Guldbrand__ and I've been studying **Computer Science and Engineering** at Chalmer's University of Technology since 2016. On top of that I am an avid gamer and sci-fi/fantasy enthusiast.

I am usually working on some project or another and this site is a central repository for my work. Under [projects](/projects/) you can browse much of what I've done, both more serious work, as well as small personal projects. I also keep a  [blog](/blog/) for when I feel the need to publish my thoughts on some matter.

Some of my projects are educational in nature, owing in part to my recent work as a teaching assistant for a few Chalmer's courses. In particular, me and a friend wrote [a compendium](/portfolio/data-structures/) for one of our favourite courses. We were thus very happy to see it [recommended as complimentary literature](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2018/course/DAT037_Datastrukturer/resources.html) for the course in question.

If you wish to contact me, e-mail is probably your best bet! You should be able to find up-to-date links in the page footer below!
