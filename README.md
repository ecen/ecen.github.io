## First time installation

Make sure you have a working ruby installation. I use rvm and `rvm install ruby --latest`.

Make sure jekyll is installed. `gem install bundler jekyll`

Install all gems. `gem install`

## Usage

Run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run dev server.

Commit and push to master to make changes live.
