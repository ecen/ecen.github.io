title: A Proposition of Copyright Law

Current copyright law makes little sense. Big companies and copyright trolls are free to bully small creators, and small creators don't have the resources to enforce their own claims. To accommodate a society were most people hold some copyright, this needs to change.

I am no lawyer, but this is my idea for what principles a copyright law _should_ be based on.

## ยง1 Creator Protection
A creator of intellectual property is granted certain exclusive rights to their work. This gives them a head start on monetizing their work, should they wish to do so.

### Idea Protection
_A creator is allowed sole benefit of their concept for a short time (10-20 years)._

For instance, if someone writes a story about an original character, others may not distribute their own stories about this character while idea protection applies.

This is similar to how copyright protection works today, but much shorter. People do write Harry Potter fanfiction, but it isn't something they can widely publish or sell without permission.

The idea protection time period running out does not mean that others may pose as the original author. As an example, idea protection running out for Harry potter means you may publish and sell Harry Potter books, as long as you make sure it is clear that you are not affiliated with J.K. Rowling, the original author.

### Work Protection
_A creator is allowed sole benefit of the product of their work and very similar variations of it, for a long time (50 years)._

To use the previous example, when idea protection for Harry Potter runs out, fanfiction may be published and sold, but the original Harry Potter books are still protected. No one may sell digitalized versions, reprints or derivative works that are very similar to the original (versions that only adds a few chapters, revises sentence structure, spelling etc.).

### Credit Rights
_Derivative works should make reasonable effort to credit the creator of the original work for a very long time._

As long as the creator of the original work is alive and has not made active attempts at distancing themselves, they should be credited. An original creator may not be referenced such that they falsely seem to support the derivative work.

## ยง2 Consumer Protection
When a work as been published, some restrictions apply to the exclusive rights of the creator. This protects all possible consumers from anti-competitive and anti-consumer behaviour by the creator and strengthens free speech.

### Fair Use
_Commentary, criticism, parody, etc. is always allowed and can include small parts of the protected work._

This is intended to work the same way as current fair use policies do. However, consistently or carelessly preventing fair use must be heavily punished to hinder large companies and copyright trolls from bullying small creators.

### No Unpublishing
_Creators do not have the right to unpublish their work. If a published work is repeatedly made unavailable, or made unavailable for a short time (1 year), idea and work protection are permanently removed._

The idea is that no one is allowed to hold rights to anything just to prevent others from having it. It is also intended to prevent anti-consumer practices like the [Disney Vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Vault).

A work may also be counted as unavailable if its price is raised, or lowered dramatically in short periods, in such a way that the product might as well be unavailable for many consumers.

How quickly unpublishing is applied may vary between types of work. Availability for physical goods may be more forgiving than for digital, since the former must be crafted copy-by-copy. Hand-made physical goods may be given even more leeway.

### No Exclusivity
(While inherently good for the consumer, I reckon that no exclusivity is less important and might bring more difficulties than any other point. It is thus the least crucial.)

_No third party may be granted an **exclusive** right to produce or publish a work. In addition, consumers must not be charged multiple times for digital goods on multiple platforms._

A creator is not required to make their work available on more than one platform, but third parties may freely make the work available on other platforms as long as reasonable measures are taken to reimburse the creator with the same amount as they would receive for sales on the original platform. However, third parties must make reasonable effort to make sure that consumers are not charged multiple times for digital goods.

Some examples of platform transversal include printing a digital book, digitizing a printed book, translating a text, porting a game to run on a different system, or selling a work on a different distribution platform or market.
