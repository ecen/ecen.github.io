## Greetings!

I am __Eric Guldbrand__. Online I often go by __Ecen__. I study computer science at Chalmer's University of Technology in Gothenburg but I am also an avid gamer and sci-fi/fantasy enthusiast.

This site hosts my résumé and portfolio but serves likewise as a repository for more personal projects. My intention is to some extent make clear who I am, and to provide a bunch of hopefully useful code snippets and programs for the interested.

If you wish to contact me there are several links for that on this page, but e-mail might be your best bet.
