This is a game playing system implemented by me and Algot Johansson during a course on the design of AI systems in 2020. It is implemented in Kotlin and uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to play a two-player snake game (similar to [Achtung, Die Kurve!](https://achtungdiekurve.net/)) where both players move simultaneously each turn. The game playing system outperforms random, simple scripted and human players, but has a tendency to seek out draws.
