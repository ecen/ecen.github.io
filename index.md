# Greetings!
---

My name is __Eric Guldbrand__ and I've been studying **Computer Science and Engineering** at Chalmer's University of Technology since 2016. On top of that I am an avid gamer and sci-fi/fantasy enthusiast.

Always working on some project or another, this site is a central repository for my work. Under [portfolio](/portfolio/) you will find my most polished work and under [personal](/personal/) I keep things that are perhaps not so serious, but fun to share nonetheless. I also keep a small [blog](/blog/) for when I feel the need to weigh in on some matter.

Quite a few of my portfolio projects are educational in nature. This owes in part to that I've recently been working as a teaching assistant for a few Chalmer's courses. This has been very rewarding, and inspired me and a friend to write [a compendium](/portfolio/data-structures/) for one of our favourite courses. We were thus very happy to see it [recommended as complimentary literature](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2018/course/DAT037_Datastrukturer/resources.html) for the course in question.

If you wish to contact me there are several links for that on this page, but e-mail might be your best bet.
