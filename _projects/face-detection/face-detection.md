# Face Detection using Viola-Jones Object Detection Framework

As part of the Chalmer's course *TIN175 Introduction to Artificial intelligence* we were tasked with implementing [Viola-Jones Object Detection Framework](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/viola-cvpr-01.pdf) based on one of their papers. The implementation and accompanying short report was written in collaboration between myself, Algot Johansson, Daniel Felczak, Oskar Gr√∂nqvist and Rikard Helgegren.

When run on the group photo of the 1927 Solvay Conference, the result can be seen in the image above. The agent we trained often mistakes ties for faces, but otherwise works quite well. More details can be found in the report.
