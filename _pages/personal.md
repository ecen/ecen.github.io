## Youtube
I don't really make YouTube videos. Occasionally while playing games however, I record something that I want to show a friend, or just save for myself. Because YouTube is by far the easiest way to share videos, I tend to upload those videos to my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQEFyGppq7vKkvl27dZy-bg). Feel free to browse, but don't expect much!

## [Wonderdraft Projects](/wonderdraft/)
[Wonderdraft](https://www.wonderdraft.net) is a tool developed by Megasploot  for easily creating stylized fantasy maps. I've had some fun with this tool and I have put my work and some custom assets I've created [here](/wonderdraft/).

## Minecraft Resource Pack: Lunaris
[Lunaris](/assets/docs/Lunaris.zip) is a small resource pack I made for Minecraft. It makes the moon square (why would the Minecraft moon be round??) and changes the look of armour to something more interesting.

<div class="slider">
  <img class='photo'  src="/assets/images/lunaris/iron-compare.png" alt="" />
  <img class='photo'  src="/assets/images/lunaris/gold-compare.png" alt="" />
  <img class='photo'  src="/assets/images/lunaris/diamond-compare.png" alt="" />
  <img class='photo'  src="/assets/images/lunaris/moon-compare.png" alt="" />
</div>

If you want this resource pack to be default on your server you may want to set the `resource-pack-sha1=` in your server.properties file to this pack's SHA1 which is `71C1A9AD830D36E93D5DE7B08CC9238866200DC4`. This allows clients to detect if the pack has been updated and re-download it. Note that this hash will update when the resource pack updates.
